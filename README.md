The  STP  Payroll  Management  System  (or  STP)  will  consist  of  two  main  components,  an  administrative 
component, and an STP component. 
 
The administrative section will allow, through text-based menus, the login and logout of employers, the addition 
and removal of employees in the system, the display of employees records, the display of a certain employee 
with name, and the update of employees’ accounts. 
 
The STP component will store a list of all the payroll information of the employees and a list of the summary 
of the payrolls. The STP component will also allow the creation and display of the payroll information report 
based  on  date.  Finally,  the  STP  component  will  also  handle  the  display  of  a  certain  employee  payroll 
information. 
 
Each employee record will include the employee’s name, email, phone, address, TFN, type, paid hours and 
hourly rate. 
 
Each payroll record will include the employee’s name, its wages, its tax, its net and its super.
